Deedy-Resume
=========================

Here I host the latest version of my resume using the **XeLaTeX** layout from the repo I'm forking from, which utilizes a single column "twist" found [here](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/single-column-deedy-cv-slash-resume-template/zwyxmkbrfgtz) as well as some other personal modifications :grin:.
